------------------------

[AlyxVance](https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Alyx_Vance) is a collection of blockwise parallel algorithms implemented in CUDA, intentionally not using much of the [CCCL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl) library. AlyxVance is based on C++20 and CUDA 12 or newer.

This is a side project just for fun, learning, and exploration. Do not use it in production code.
